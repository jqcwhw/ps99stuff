## üéÆ Interactive Training Guide

### Learning Items
1. Start "Learn Items" mode from the web dashboard
2. Hover your mouse over any game item
3. Press SPACE and specify the item type (chest, egg, breakable, etc.)
4. The bot captures a screenshot and learns the item's visual signature

### Mapping Zones
1. Start "Map Zones" mode from the web dashboard
2. Click 4 corners on the screen to define a boundary
3. Specify zone type (breakables, fishing, safe zone)
4. The bot will respect these boundaries during automation

### Natural Language Interaction
Type commands like:
- "map the breakable area"
- "learn chest items" 
- "find similar items on screen"
- "analyze what's currently visible"

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Systems
- **Vision System**: OpenCV-based screen analysis and object detection
- **Automation Engine**: PyAutoGUI-based input simulation with safety mechanisms
- **Learning System**: Pattern recognition and experience-based improvement
- **Knowledge Manager**: Information storage and retrieval from multiple sources
- **Interactive Trainer**: Real-time teaching and mapping capabilities

### Data Storage
- **JSON Files**: Configuration, knowledge base, macros, and game elements
- **Pickle Files**: Binary storage for learning data and experience memory
- **Local Storage**: No external database dependencies

### Safety Features
- **Forbidden Regions**: Prevents clicking on unsafe screen areas
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Stays within defined game windows
- **Rate Limiting**: Human-like timing and delays
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from automation failures

## üîß Configuration

The bot automatically creates configuration files on first run:
- `config/settings.json` - Main configuration
- `data/learned_items.json` - Interactive training data
